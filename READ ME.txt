*The main loop is located in Main_1

* Inverse kinematics is located in IK_Tripton_PF_UP

*The forward kinematics of the VJM model is in the file FK_VJM

* 2 functions for the 2 jacobians Jq & Jt

* The main function of the VJM is called Kc_VJM which calls Kc_def to compute the stiffness matrix that
is used to compute the deflection vector
